  "title": "Pricing principle via Tsallis relative entropy in incomplete market",
  "text": "A pricing principle is proposed for non-attainable q-exponential bounded contingent claims in an incomplete Brownian motion market setting. This pricing functional is compatible with prices for attainable claims, and it is defined by the solution of a specific quadratic backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). Except translation invariance, the pricing principle processes lots of elegant properties, such as monotonicity, time consistency, concavity etc. Tsallis relative entropy theory is found to be closely related to this pricing criterion. The buyer evaluates the contingent claim under the ``distorted Radon-Nikodym derivative'' and adjustment by Tsallis relative entropy over a family of equivalent martingale measures. The asymptotic behavior of the pricing principle for risk aversion coefficient is also investigated. The pricing functional is proved between minimal martingale measure pricing and conditional certainty equivalence of q-exponential utility."
