  "title": "Skyrmions and Their Sizes in Helimagnets",
  "text": "Skyrmion gases and lattices in helimagnets are studied, and the size of a Skyrmion in various phases is estimated. For isolated Skyrmions, the long distance tail is related to the magnetization correlation functions and exhibits power-law decay if the phase spontaneously breaks a continuous symmetry, but decays exponentially otherwise. The size of a Skyrmion is found to depend on a number of length scales. These length scales are related to the strength of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, the thermal correlation lengths, and the strength of the external magnetic field. An Abrikosov lattice of Skyrmions is found to exist near the helimagnetic phase boundary, and the core-to-core distance is estimated."
